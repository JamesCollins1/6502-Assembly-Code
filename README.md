# 6502-Assembly-Code
A repository for my Assembly code project.
This project was set during my BSc Computing for Games course. I was set the breif of creating a game for the NES gaming system.  I took it as an opportunity to learn some
Assembly code programming. 

There is an emulator in this repo too, FCEUX.
Run the emulator then run the ROM that is in the Battleships folder and the game should run.
